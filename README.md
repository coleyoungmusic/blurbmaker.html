Currently I work for a non profit organization that provides grant money to patients who are needing help paying for their prescription medications.  The company has many tools for us to use in order to make sure we are providing solid customer service to those who are needing copay assistance.  One such tool that we use is called the "blurb tool".  It consists of a simple template that has specific key points that determine if the patient qualifies or not.  These key points are marked in parenthesis.  I found that the most tedious task was to have to highlight these parts and type in the information and then at the end you had to highlight everything and finally copy and paste your note into another program that documents each call.  This had proven to be even more difficult with a mouse pointer that has a mind of it's own!  So officially my first real project I wrote in Python back when I started was to eliminate the need to highlight parts just to fill in the blanks.  Instead the program I wrote allowed me to simply type in the information to the common questions that are asked in the application process and then give the user the full blurb at the end based off of the input provided.  Writing this program eventually inspired me to give it some meat and bones by finding out how I could make it web based.  What you have here is the simplest of the simple but for what I do it has been a tremendous help.  Enjoy!!
